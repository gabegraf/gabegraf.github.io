I'm a computational chemist passionate about using chemical theory to accelerate the design and discovery of novel materials for renewable energy and energy-efficient technologies.

I'm am current working on my Ph.D. in the Thomas Lord Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science at Duke University. I work as a graduate research assistant in the Ab Initio Materials Simulations (AIMS) group, lead by Volker Blum. I am also a part of the AI + Materials National Research Traineeship (aiM-NRT) at Duke University, where I study methods to incorporate AI into the materials science research.

My current research focuses on Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Perovskites. I am interested in finding new ways to enhance their stability and predict their phase transitions. I am also interested how subtle structural factors influence their electronic properties. Additionally, I am working to develop new functionalities for the all-electron, hybrid DFT software, FHI-aims. 

I hold a Bachelors of Arts in Chemistry with a minor in Mathematics from Austin College in Sherman, TX. During my undergraduate, I conducted research in organic chemistry, bioinorganic chemistry, and human physiology in extreme environments.
